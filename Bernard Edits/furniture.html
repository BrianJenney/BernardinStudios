<h3>FURNITURE</h3>
	<P> We have been designing furniture and lighting fixtures for over twenty years. The pieces were not necessarily specified and assembled as a refined commercial product, but they are a study of lines and proportions that could be realized quickly and inexpensively with basic steel and woodworking tools. We have developed well over one hundred designs with over fifty of them constructed.</P>

	<P>Currently we are developing a refined second generation line for the contact furniture market. </P>
