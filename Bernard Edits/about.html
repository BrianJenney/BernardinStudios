Robert Bernardin, Architect Principal</p>
<br>
<p><q>What I enjoy most about the construction process is the beginning, the strength and immediacy of the vision, and the end, the skillful and successful realization of that vision.</q></p>
<br>
<h3>Background and Profile</h3>

<p>Robert Bernardin has been in the construction industry since his teen years, working as a carpenter and a steelworker, then attending U.C. Berkeley in his mid-twenties to study architecture.</p>
<p>Mr. Bernardin received his first commission to design and build the Ace Cafe in San Francisco. Using his skills acquired in the trades, he pioneered an industrial steel aesthetic which was published worldwide. It continues to be an influence for design today.</p>

<p>Since then, Bernardin studios has completed over 70 projects, half in San Francisco. We believe in sustainable design, always exploring the both efficiency and elegance in all we do. Most importantly, we value working with our clients to provide a service that produces not only a masterful end product, but is exemplar of what a business relationship can be.</p>
